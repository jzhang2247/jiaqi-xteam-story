Once upon a time, there is a king name William. He governs the land in 
southeast Europe, and has a daughter named Elizabeth. When William was 70s
he was too old to run the country, so it is time for Elizabeth to do her job.â‰ˆ

Elizabeth enjoyed how her father governed the land, however she wanted to rule
in her own way. Once she was made the Queen, the people of the land all 
celebrated because they all knew that she would be a fantastic ruler. She
was more lenient than her father when people need help, and the people admired
her for that. 

However the people would soon find out her secret intentions. She wanted to
become richer than her father had and take over nearby land. Once it was clear
what her true intentions were, there was uproar and chaos all over the land
until one day she recieved a letter from her long-lost brother Nickolas III. 

The letter detailed about Nickolas III's adventures around the world. To 
Elizabeth, it was USELESS. The only thing she cared about was making money. So
When she read the letter, she become scared her brother would return and take
the throne from her. To prevent this, she paid mercenaries to kill him.
