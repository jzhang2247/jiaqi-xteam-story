Once upon a time, there is a king name William. He governs the land in 
southeast Europe, and has a daughter named Elizabeth. When William was 70s
he was too old to run the country, so it is time for Elizabeth to do her job.â‰ˆ

Elizabeth enjoyed how her father governed the land, however she wanted to rule
in her own way. Once she was made the Queen, the people of the land all 
celebrated because they all knew that she would be a fantastic ruler. She
was more lenient than her father when people need help, and the people admired
her for that.
